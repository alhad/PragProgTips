PragProgTips
============

I really enjoyed reading [The Pragmatic Programmer](http://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer) by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas, and some of the tips that were scattered throughout the book were things that I really wanted to remember. 

So rather than try and commit 70 pragmatic tips to memory, I thought I would make a simple page that would show a random tip when loaded. Using the Chrome extension [New Tab Redirect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna), I can see a random Pragmatic tip every time I open a new tab.
